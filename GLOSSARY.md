Downloading the latest changes from GitHub to your computer.

**Template** 📋

## Data Terms

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** 📊  
A way to store data that both humans and computers can read easily. Like a digital filing cabinet.

**JSON in Python:**
```python
import json

# Convert Python data to JSON string
data = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
json_string = json.dumps(data)  # '{"name": "John", "age": 25}'

# Convert JSON string back to Python
python_data = json.loads(json_string)  # {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}

# Save to file
with open('data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f)

# Load from file
with open('data.json', 'r') as f:
    loaded_data = json.load(f)
```

**Array/List** 📝  
A collection of items in order. Like a shopping list or a queue of people.

<img src="image\"title.jpg" alt="My Image">

<!-- Or use single quotes -->
<img src='image"title.jpg' alt="My Image">
```

**HTML Attributes** 🏷️  
Extra information you add to HTML tags. Like `src="image.jpg"` or `alt="Description"`.

**HTML Entities** ⚡

- `&lt;` instead of `<`
- `&gt;` instead of `>`
- `&amp;` instead of `&`
- `&quot;` instead of `"`
- `&apos;` instead of `'`

A tool that automatically checks if your code works correctly by running tests.

**Test** ✅  
Code that checks if your main code works as expected. Like a practice quiz for your program.

**CI (Continuous Integration)** 🔄
